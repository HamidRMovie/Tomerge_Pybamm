Ensure to paste the data in the corresponding subfolders.

- Run [Calendar Aging](./calendar_aging_sensitivity.ipynb) to simulate the sensitivity of SEI model with accelerated simulations
- Run [Calendar Aging Long](./calendar_aging_sensitivity.ipynb) to simulate the sensitivity of SEI model with normal simulations
- Run [Calendar Aging Plots Base](./calendar_aging_sens_ana_base.ipynb) to plot the sensitivity of SEI model with respect to the baseline simulation
- Run [Calendar Aging Plots Data](./calendar_aging_sens_ana_base.ipynb) to analyze the sensitivity of SEI model using RMSE with respect to the data.
