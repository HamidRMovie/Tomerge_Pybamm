- Run [fast_sim](./fast_sim_clean.ipynb) to simulate Aging for C/5 cycling (ACC Code)
- Run [fast_sim_exp](./fast_sim.ipynb) to simulate aging and expansion for C/5 cycling. Included differntial voltage and expansion analysis
- Run [predict_aging](./predict_aging.ipynb) to train and plot parameters using partial data window.
- Run [predict_aging_par](./predict_aging_par.ipynb) to train and plot parameters using partial data window with simulations running parallely to reduce simulation time. 
- Run [predict_aging_ECS_plots](./predict_aging_ECS_plots.ipynb) to generate plots for ECS 2022 including new analysis for predicing 50% DOD case
